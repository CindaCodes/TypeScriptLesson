# ðŸŽ“ TypeScript Course with Codevolution

Welcome to my TypeScript learning journey!  
This repo is based on the [TypeScript tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gieEQFIfgYc) by Codevolution on YouTube.

I'm using this repo to follow along with the course, deleting and rewriting the code with each lesson. I commit after every lesson so I can easily go back and see how my understanding has grown over time.

ðŸ§ª Topics Covered:
- Type annotations
- Functions & arrays
- Tuples & enums
- Interfaces & types
- Classes & access modifiers
- Generics
- Modules and more!
